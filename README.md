## Car Reviews Website

This Website has a focus on the latest reviews about luxury sports cars. The website is for a user that is potentially thinking about getting the new car,
but also for all car lowers. If you are interested in buying a new car and you are not sure which one to buy, this is the right place for you.
Everything that you need to know about cars, you will find on my Website.

My project has its opening page where you can see Opening video and the latest three reviews that I did. I divided reviews into 3 categories;
Petrol, Hybrid and fully Electric car. In each category, you can find the last two reviewed cars. The following menu item allows users to see all reviewed
cars in one place. I added a gallery with a few lovely pictures of reviewed cars and the one that I have a plan to do in a close future.
If you have any suggestions and you would like to see any car reviewed, or you just have any other questions, you will find the contact on the last menu item.

## UX

The website is for individuals interested in cars, sports cars and luxury sports cars, who want to know more about it.
This website allows individuals to see pictures and read interesting articles from the latest tests. If individuals are thinking about buying 
electric, petrol, hybrid or any car and they are not 100% sure which one is perfect for them, this website will help with it.
After reading reviews it's gonna be easier to make the decision.

- As a new user, I want to see a description of a car so that I can know more about it
- As a new user, I would like to read about new cars if I decide to buy it
- As a possible new car buyer, I would like to read about the car before I go for a test drive
- As a car lower I would like to see reviews from an experienced person and also give my suggestions
- As a user, I just want to see car pictures, read reviews and dream about beautiful cars
- As a user, I can research about cars and see which one suits me best; petrol, hybrid or electric car.
